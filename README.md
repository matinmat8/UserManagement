# Authentication Service (Go + Redis + Swagger)

This project is a simple authentication service built with **Golang**, **Redis**, and documented using **Swagger**.  
It supports OTP login, JWT token management, and user listing with pagination and search.  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed  
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed  

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run (Dockerized)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/auth-service.git
   cd auth-service


2 - Generate Swagger docs (only needed during development):

    go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
    swag init -g main.go -o ./docs


The generated docs/ folder should already be in the repo.
If youâ€™re running just with Docker, you donâ€™t need to run this step.


3- Start the application with Docker Compose:
```
  docker-compose up --build
```

4- The services will be available at:
Go API â†’ http://localhost:8080
Redis â†’ localhost:6379


ðŸ“– API Documentation (Swagger)
Swagger UI is served directly from the app.
Once the container is running, open:
ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html


ðŸ›  Environment Variables

The app uses the following environment variables (configured in docker-compose.yml):

| Variable     | Default | Description        |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------ |
| `REDIS_HOST` | redis   | Redis service name |
| `REDIS_PORT` | 6379    | Redis port         |


ðŸ§¹ Useful Commands

- Rebuild containers:
``` docker-compose up --build ```

- Stop containers:
```docker-compose down```

- View logs:
```docker-compose logs -f <container_id>```

- Enter Redis CLI:
```docker exec -it redis redis-cli```

Example log entry:
``` ERROR File: middleware/error.go, Line: 42, ErrorMessage: "An Error Occurred", ErrorDetails: "sql: no rows in result set" ```


ðŸ”— Integration of Logger with Error Handling
The middleware and logger work together:
1- Middleware catches panics.
2- If the panic contains an error (pm.Error), it builds a map[string]interface{} with details:
``` eventData := map[string]interface{}{
    "error":   *pm.Error,
    "depth":   4,
    "message": "An Error Occurred",
}
logger.LogErrorWithDepth(eventData)
```
3- LogErrorWithDepth finds the file and line number where the error originated and writes it into the log file.
4- Client still receives a clean JSON response, while developers get full debugging details in the logs.

âœ… This setup ensures:
- Developers: Detailed error tracking in logs.
- Clients: Clean, user-friendly error messages.
- System: Stability (no crashes from panics).
